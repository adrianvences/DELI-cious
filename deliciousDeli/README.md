![Generic Type Method Example](images/genericMethodExample.png)
We learned about Generic types in class, and they caught my attention. I knew that I wanted to learn more about
them and implement them into my project for more DRY code. In this example I made a generic method that reads data
from a CSV file and creates a list of products based on that data. It also implements an interface named IncludedProduct.
It is a functionalInterface and holds the method to create a product.
